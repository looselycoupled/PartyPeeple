"Have you ever wanted to put a Facebook friend on autopilot? Make them think you care without the time commitment of leaving a meaningful birthday message or the trouble of reading their ranting comments. A "like" here, a comment there — just enough to make it believable? Well, Pepys Inc. has what you've been looking for."  NPR, All Things Considered
